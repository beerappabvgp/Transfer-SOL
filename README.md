# Transferring SOL on the Solana Blockchain

This guide will help you transfer SOL from one account to another using a web interface with a connected wallet, such as Phantom.

## Prerequisites

2. **Create Accounts:** Ensure you have two Solana accounts: a source account with sufficient SOL and a destination account.

## Steps to Transfer SOL

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Open the web application and connect your wallet using the Phantom browser extension or another compatible wallet.

When prompted by the Phantom wallet, review the transaction details and sign the transaction.

### Step 5: Submit the Transaction to the Blockchain

After signing, submit the transaction to the Solana blockchain by clicking the submit button in the web interface.
